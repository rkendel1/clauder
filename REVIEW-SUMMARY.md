## üéØ Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Strongly Validated Strengths

1. **Universal Provider Architecture**
   - 8+ providers supported
   - ~1,800 lines of provider code
   - All providers treated equally
   - Easy extensibility

2. **Multi-Layer Caching**
   - RepoMap for workspace context
   - SQLite tags cache
   - Generic cache manager
   - Prompt caching (90% cost reduction)

3. **Deep Git Integration**
   - GitHandler class
   - Auto-commits with messages
   - Diff generation and review
   - Complete audit trail
   - `/undo` command

4. **Self-Hosting Capabilities**
   - Docker one-command setup
   - Local model support (Ollama, LM Studio)
   - No cloud dependencies required
   - Full data control

5. **Professional UI**
   - 15 React/TypeScript components
   - Modern tech stack (Vite)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified Gap

**Enterprise Features**
- Missing: SSO/SAML integration
- Missing: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Missing: SOC2 certification
- Missing: Centralized audit logging
- Missing: Enterprise SLA/support

**Impact:** Cannot fully claim "enterprise-grade" until these are implemented

**Recommendation:** Use "privacy-focused with strong auditability" instead
