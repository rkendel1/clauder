# Multi-Provider Support

## Overview

Clauder is built with a **universal provider architecture** that allows you to use any AI provider without vendor lock-in. The extension supports multiple providers equally, giving you the flexibility to choose the best model for your needs.

## Supported Providers

Clauder currently supports the following AI providers:

### Direct Provider Integration

- **Anthropic** - Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- **OpenAI** - GPT-4, GPT-3.5, O1, O3 models
- **DeepSeek** - DeepSeek V3 and reasoning models
- **Google** - Gemini models via Google AI Studio
- **Mistral** - Mistral AI models
- **OpenRouter** - Access to 100+ models from various providers
- **Kodu** - Kodu AI tunnel for Claude models

### Custom Providers

- **OpenAI-Compatible** - Any API that implements the OpenAI-compatible interface
  - Local models (LM Studio, Ollama)
  - Custom endpoints
  - Self-hosted solutions

## Key Features

### üîÑ Easy Provider Switching
Switch between providers seamlessly without losing your workflow. The interface remains consistent regardless of which provider you're using.

### üí∞ Cost Transparency
See token usage and costs for each request, helping you manage your API budget effectively.

### üîê Secure Credential Management
API keys and credentials are stored securely using VSCode's secret storage mechanism.

### üéØ Model Selection
Choose from a wide range of models, each optimized for different tasks:
- Coding and development
- Reasoning and analysis
- Fast responses
- Cost-effective options

### ‚ö° Smart Features
- **Prompt caching** - Reduce costs and latency for supported providers
- **Context window management** - Automatic handling of conversation history
- **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks and clear error messages
- **Token optimization** - Efficient use of context windows

## Architecture Principles

### No Vendor Lock-In
The extension is designed to be provider-agnostic:
- All providers use the same interface
- No provider receives preferential treatment
- Easy to add new providers
- Seamless provider migration

### Universal Provider System
All providers are treated equally in the architecture:
- Unified configuration system
- Consistent error handling
- Shared authentication mechanism
- Same user experience

### Extensibility
The plugin-based architecture makes it easy to:
- Add new providers
- Support new models
- Implement custom handlers
- Integrate with new APIs

## Switching Providers

You can switch providers at any time:

1. Open Clauder settings
2. Select a different provider
3. Choose a model
4. Continue your conversation

**Note:** Your conversation history is preserved when switching providers, allowing you to continue your work seamlessly.

## Best Practices

### Choosing a Provider

Consider these factors when selecting a provider:

- **Task complexity**: Use more powerful models (GPT-4, Claude Opus) for complex tasks
- **Cost**: Balance performance with budget using cost-effective options
- **Speed**: Choose faster models (Claude Haiku, GPT-3.5) for quick iterations
- **Features**: Select providers with specific features you need (vision, reasoning, etc.)
- **Privacy**: Consider data handling policies of different providers

### Managing Costs

Tips for cost-effective usage:

- Use prompt caching when available
- Start with faster models for exploration
- Switch to more powerful models when needed
- Monitor token usage in the UI
- Use context window efficiently

### Optimizing Performance

- Enable prompt caching for supported providers
- Use appropriate context window sizes
- Clear conversation history when starting new tasks
- Choose models optimized for your use case

## Technical Details

For developers and advanced users who want to understand or extend the provider system:

- **Architecture Documentation**: See `extension/src/api/providers/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Provider Implementation Guide**: See `extension/src/api/providers/README.md`
- **Migration Guide**: See `extension/src/api/providers/MIGRATION.md`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Provider not available**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check provider service status
- Ensure you have credits/quota available

**Model not found**
- Provider may have updated their model names
- Try refreshing the model list
- Check provider documentation for current models

**Rate limits**
- Most providers have rate limits
- Consider upgrading your plan
- Implement retry logic or switch providers temporarily

**Authentication errors**
- Re-enter your API key
- Check key permissions and scopes
- Verify key hasn't expired

## Future Plans

We're continuously improving multi-provider support:

- Additional provider integrations
- Enhanced model comparison tools
- Automatic provider fallback
- Cost optimization features
- Performance monitoring
