The Browser Inspector panel opens beside your editor!

### Step 3: Inspect Elements

2. Hover over elements in the web page to see them highlighted
3. Click any element to:
   - See its CSS selector in the status bar
   - Send it to Claude for AI analysis
   - View details in VS Code Output Console

## üí° Pro Tips

- Works with any http/https URL

### CSS Selectors
The inspector generates smart selectors like:

### View Detailed Logs
1. Go to View ‚Üí Output
2. Select "Kuhmpel" from the dropdown

If you have Claude available, selected elements are automatically sent for analysis with the message:
```
Explain this component: [CSS selector]
```

### Panel doesn't open
- Check VS Code Output Console for errors
- Reload VS Code window: `Cmd/Ctrl + R`
- Verify the extension is activated

### Inspect Mode not working
- Likely CORS restriction from external site
- Try with `http://localhost:3000` instead
